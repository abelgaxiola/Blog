  <excerpt>Maybe you know someone that is studying to take the US citizenship test; if so, then send her/him the website link. I can tell you that I took the test and failed in more than one answer.  Go ahead and see how much you “really” know about U.S. history and government.</excerpt>

The test is an oral test and the applicant will be asked 10 questions (taken from the 100 provided) from which at least 6 must be answered correctly in order to pass the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="border: 0px; font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 1.625em; outline: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(55, 55, 55);"&gt;Maybe you know someone that is studying to take the test; if so, then send her/him the website link.
