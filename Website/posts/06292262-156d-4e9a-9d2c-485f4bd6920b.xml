  <excerpt>If you are a .NET developer and are looking to leverage the power and flexibility of cloud computing allow me to suggest you take a look at AppHarbor and what it has to offer.  Here is my short list of what impressed me the most about AppHarbor.</excerpt>
  <content>&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;; font-size: medium;"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;A while back I heard a podcast having to do with cloud technology and platform as a service provided by AppHarbor (&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130208024753/http://hanselminutes.com/255/the-opinionated-cloud-learning-about-appharbor"&gt;listen to it here&lt;/a&gt;).  At that time I didn’t pay much attention past the fact that it was an interesting conversation regarding a technology that I keep under the radar ever since I attended a talk regarding Amazon’s cloud offerings.  Last time I did anything having to do with similar technology was when MS was promoting Azure by offering limited free accounts.  I remember being very excited and quickly signing up for my free account.  Azure was fun and I did learn some new concepts but was never able to justify converting my free account to a pay account – at least not for my personal consumption.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;; font-size: medium;"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Well, I don’t have to justify anything anymore.  AppHarbor’s website greets you with the following words: Azure done right.  And after spending some hours working with it I have to conclude that this is indeed the truth.  Disclaimer: I haven’t revisited Azure recently but the last time I checked it was still not free (there is a free 90 days trial but you need a credit card to create the account – you can guess what happens after the 90 days).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;; font-size: medium;"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;If you are a .NET developer and are looking to leverage the power and flexibility of cloud computing allow me to suggest you take a look at AppHarbor and what it has to offer.  Here is my short list of what impressed me the most about AppHarbor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;; font-size: medium;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Extremely fast deployment of .NET solutions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Integrates with BitBucket in a seamless manner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Free application hosting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Free SQL Server DB (20 MB)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;; font-size: medium;"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;I have to admit that deploying my first app to the cloud via AppHarbor was not as easy as some articles make it to be, but after I was able to resolve my issues the simplicity of deploying became clear.  I have a new perspective regarding the tools and the deployment cycle; from using TortoiseHg, to versioning in the cloud (BitBucket), and automatically deploying to AppHarbor.  The fruits of my labor are nothing to brag about but the learning experience was priceless.  Check it out: &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130208024753/http://abeleba.apphb.com/"&gt;http://abeleba.apphb.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;; font-size: medium;"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Here are some articles that got me started:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;; font-size: medium;"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130208024753/http://blogs.infosupport.com/using-appharbor-bitbucket-and-mercurial-with-asp-net-and-silverlight-part-1/"&gt;Using AppHarbor, Bitbucket and Mercurial with ASP.NET and Silverlight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;; font-size: medium;"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130208024753/http://www.emadibrahim.com/2011/05/03/appharbor-asp-net-mvc-orchard-awesome/"&gt;AppHarbor + ASP.NET MVC + Orchard = Awesome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;; font-size: medium;"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130208024753/http://support.appharbor.com/kb/api/integrating-with-bitbucket"&gt;Integrating with Bitbucket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>
